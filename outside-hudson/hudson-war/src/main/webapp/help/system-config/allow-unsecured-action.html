     If Hudson is secured using any of the authorization scheme, then minimally READ permission is 
     required to send request and perform some actions in Hudson. However, few unsecured actions 
     could be allowed such as prompting Hudson to do SCM polling via SCM commit hooks. Though
     unsecured actions are assumed harmless, but may prone to Denial of service attack in a pubic Hudson.
     So, extreme caution must be exercised while allowing unsecured actions in Hudson.
