/**
 * Thrown when a system entity that is needed to perform a service level action
 * cannot be found within the system. <p> An example of where this may be useful
 * is when a source project identified by a project name may not exist any more,
 * and therefore cannot be copied to a new project. Also, typically of the
 * service APIs, all {@literal get*} methods may throw this when an entity is
 * not found. <p> Extend this class with a specific implementation for each type
 * of system entity that may not be found. <p> Service API users should do their
 * best to verify an entity exists prior to performing an operation that may
 * trigger this exception.
