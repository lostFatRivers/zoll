/**

 *
 * <p> This extension point encapsulates the knowledge of a particular test
 * report format and its parsing process, thereby improving the pluggability of
 * test result parsing; integration with a new test tool can be done by just
 * writing a parser, without writing a custom {@link hudson.tasks.Publisher},
 * and the test reports are displayed with the default UI and recognized by the
 * rest of Hudson as test reports.
 *
 * <p> Most typical implementations of this class should extend from
 * {@link DefaultTestResultParserImpl}, which handles a set of default error
 * checks on user inputs.
 *
 * <p> Parsers are stateless, and the
 * {@link #parse(String, hudson.model.AbstractBuild, hudson.Launcher, hudson.model.TaskListener)}
 * method can be concurrently invoked by multiple threads for different builds.

     * gracefully, you can just throw IOException and let the default exception
     * handling in Hudson takes care of it.
