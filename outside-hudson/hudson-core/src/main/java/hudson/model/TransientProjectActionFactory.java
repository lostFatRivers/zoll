/**
 * Extension point for inserting transient {@link Action}s into
 * {@link AbstractProject}s.
 *
 * <p> Actions of projects are primarily determined by {@link BuildStep}s that
 * are associated by configurations, but sometimes it's convenient to be able to
 * add actions across all or many projects, without being invoked through
 * configuration. This extension point provides such a mechanism.
 *
 * Actions of {@link AbstractProject}s are transient &mdash; they will not be
 * persisted, and each time Hudson starts or the configuration of the job
 * changes, they'll be recreated. Therefore, to maintain persistent data per
 * project, you'll need to do data serialization by yourself. Do so by storing a
 * file under {@link AbstractProject#getRootDir()}.
 *
 * <p> To register your implementation, put {@link Extension} on your subtype.
