<div>
    Some HTTP proxies filter out information that the default crumb issuer uses
    to calculate the nonce value. If an HTTP proxy sits between your browser client
    and your Hudson server and you receive a 403 response when submitting a form
    to Hudson, checking this option may help. Using this option makes the nonce
    value easier to forge.
