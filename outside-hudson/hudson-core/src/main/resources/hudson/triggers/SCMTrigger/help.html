  Configure Hudson to poll changes in SCM.

  <p>
  Note that this is going to be an expensive operation if you poll frequently enough
  to trigger timely builds; or it is going to be slow to respond to changes.
  Consider setting up a Git post-receive hook to avoid this overhead, as described in
  <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Using_Hudson/Building_a_software_project#Builds_by_changes_in_Git">this document</a>
  <p>
  It's possible to use Job cascading feature for this property. Please review <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/hudson/the-hudson-book/book-hudson.chunked/ch06.html#section-common-job-configurations">
  this document</a>.
