<div>
  Provides a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cron">cron</a>-like feature
  to periodically execute this job.

  <p>
  This feature is primarily for using Hudson as a cron replacement,
  and it is <b>not ideal for continuously building software jobs</b>.

  When people first start continuous integration, they are often so used to
  the idea of regularly scheduled builds like nightly/weekly that they use
  this feature. However, the point of continuous integration is to start
  a build as soon as a change is made, to provide a quick feedback to the change.
  To do that you need to
  <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Using_Hudson/Building_a_software_project#Builds_by_changes_in_Git">hook up SCM change notification to Hudson.</a>.

  <p>
  So, before using this feature, stop and ask yourself if this is really what you want.
  <p>
  It's possible to use Job cascading feature for this property. Please review <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/hudson/the-hudson-book/book-hudson.chunked/ch06.html#section-common-job-configurations">
  this document</a>.
