<div>
    This monitors the clock difference between the master and nodes.
    While Hudson itself is generally capable of tolerating clock differences between systems,
    version control activities and distributed file access (such as NFS, Windows file shares)
    tend to have strange problems when systems involved have different clocks.

    <p>
    To keep clocks in sync, refer to NTP.
