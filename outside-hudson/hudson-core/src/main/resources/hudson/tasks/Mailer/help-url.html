<div>
  Optionally specify the HTTP address of the Hudson installation, such
  as <tt>http://yourhost.yourdomain/hudson/</tt>. This is necessary in some server/proxy
  configurations because Hudson cannot reliably detect such a URL from within itself.
  
  <p>This value is used to put links into e-mails generated by Hudson and <b>internally
  when Hudson sends requests to itself</b>. Consequently, if a wrong address is
  entered, some Hudson features will be broken.
