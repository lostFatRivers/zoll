<div>
  Archives the build artifacts (for example, distribution zip files or jar files)
  so that they can be downloaded later.
  Archived files will be accessible from the Hudson webpage.
  <br />
  Normally, Hudson keeps artifacts for a build as long as a build log itself is kept,
  but if you don't need old artifacts and would rather save disk space, you can do so.
