    With this option checked, Hudson builds each configuration in a sequence.
    This can be useful if your configuration needs to access the shared resource
    like database, as well as to avoid crowding out other jobs.
    <p>
    It's possible to use Job cascading feature for this property. Please review <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/hudson/the-hudson-book/book-hudson.chunked/ch06.html#section-common-job-configurations">
